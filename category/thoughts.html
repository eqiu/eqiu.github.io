Counting stats, otherwise known as basic stats, have long dominated basketball discussion, because they are easy to understand and the data is easy to collect. 
Anyone can look at a boxscore and analyze which players had good games or bad games; the issue is that these counting stats mask the process of the ball. They only show the end result and not the process (Embiid shoutout) of how the result was created.
</p>

<p>
Take an example from finance -- below are two theoretical equity returns of two assets which show the percent return from time t=0 to time t=100. Both of these assets return 100% in 100 periods, but they have very different paths to the 100% return.
Path 1 is very straight and linear, returning 1% every day for 100 days, while path 2 has a lot more volatility and drawdowns. To a investor who does not care about the paths that the assets take and only the end result/return, the assets serve the same purpose: they return the same net amount.
This type of investor is only interested in the asset price at t=0 when he buys it and the asset price at t=100, when he sells it and cashes out. All the information this investor needs can be catpured with the two data points t=0 and t=100. 
This type of investor is similar to a person analyzing the box score, because the boxscore only contains the end result, not what happened in between to achieve that result. However, if a person was to go more granular into the asset returns and look at the day by day paths he would see that the two assets are not the same.
I bring this finance example into discussion, because not all counting stats are the same and equal, but they are often discussed as such.

By looking at the boxscore, one is able to see certain offensive categories like points, threes, rebounds, assists and defensive categories like blocks and steals.
Below is the Warriors boxscore from the Lakers-Warriors game yesterday. In this boxscore, we can see that Klay Thompson took 11 threes and made 3 while his backcourt mate Steph Curry took 9 and made 3. 
<script type="text/javascript" src="//widgets.sports-reference.com/wg.fcgi?css=1&site=bbr&url=%2Fboxscores%2F201611160TOR.html&div=div_box_gsw_basic"></script>
Suppose that Klay Thompson also took 9 threes and still made 3 of them for the same shooting percentage as Steph Curry. Then it would take a small jump of logic to say that Klay and Steph both shot 33% and had similar shooting nights.
This small jump of logic is similar to the fallacy in the two financial assets, because Steph Curry and Klay Thompson create their threes in very different ways: Klay Thompson is a lot more screen dependent then Steph Curry is. 
</p>
<p>
When Klay Thompson gets open and shoots a three, often times there are many screeners setting multiple screens to free him up. If Zaza Pachulia sets Klay Thompson a perfect screen that frees him up for a wide open shot and Klay Thompson hits the shot, Thompson gets all the credit in the boxscore. The boxscore will increase Thomspons FGA by 1 and his FGM by 1.
Zaza Pachulia gets no credit. But when Zaza Pachulia gets called for an illegal screen by attempting to free Klay Thompson up, Pachulia gets a TO credited to his box score, while Thompson gets nothing. So Thompson is getting all of the benefits of a Pachulia screen with none of the disadvantages in the boxscore, because the boxscore only focuses on the final result of a make or a miss and not the process.
An accurate statistic should incorporate the fact that Pachulia also helped in creating the shot for Klay Thompson and award him appropriately when Thompson hits a shot, while punishing Thompson when Pachulia sets an illegal screen.
